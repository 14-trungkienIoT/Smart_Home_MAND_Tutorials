# Smart_Home_MAND_Tutorials
In this repo we test each small program in the smart home project. Since the erf32 kit is not yet available, we use esp32 and stm32 as an experimental alternative. We will gradually and continuously update our tests here.
- Hardware: includes hardware connection.
- Firmware: includes testing the microcontroller's IoT protocols and the sensor's second connection protocol.
- Software: testing web server/mobile app software.
Because our team is in the process of learning and testing, it will inevitably have inadequacies, we look forward to receiving your contributions.
